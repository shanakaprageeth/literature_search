# Manual Abstract Review Guidelines & Methodology Inclusion

## When is Manual Abstract Review Needed?
Manual abstract review is required if automated filtering cannot confidently determine inclusion/exclusion based on abstracts.

## How to Perform Manual Abstract Review
1. Randomly sample abstracts from the candidate publication list.
2. Review each abstract against your inclusion/exclusion criteria.
3. Record decisions and reasons for inclusion/exclusion.
4. Update your publication list accordingly.

## Methodology Text for Literature Review Section
If manual review was performed, include the following in your methods section:

> "After automated screening, abstracts were manually reviewed by the authors according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A random sample of abstracts was assessed to ensure relevance and methodological rigor. Decisions were documented and the final publication list was updated accordingly."

## Best Practices
- Use at least two reviewers for reliability
- Resolve disagreements by consensus
- Document the process for transparency
